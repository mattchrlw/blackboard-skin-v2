# blackboard-skin-v2
An updated version of my Blackboard skin.

The CSS makes some modifications to the general aesthetic of the website, whereas the JavaScript reorganises course titles and colours different subject areas for readability. (A white course title indicates an inactive Blackboard site.)

Due to the nature of userscripting and theming, some of this code is absolutely disgusting and please be aware of that. :)

## Installation instructions
1. Create a new Stylish skin called whatever you like, and paste the code from `style.css` in. Make sure to set `URL starts with` to `https://learn.uq.edu.au`.
2. Create a new Tampermonkey script called whatever you like, and paste the code from `script.js` in.
